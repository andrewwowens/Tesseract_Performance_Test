# Tesseract_Performance_Test

A Text Accuracy Test of Tesseract on Varying Quality PNG Files

This is a simplistic test using a scale of PNG files at varying DPI and compression scales of PDF to PNG conversions using ImageMagick.
Tesseract is an OCR framework released by Google in 2006 which is traditionally used to read text from images.

All text converted here was in Times New Roman format in various text sizes from 9, 12, 14, and 24 point print. 
Parts of the text is grouped separately from standard sentence formatting and some text is italicized.

TBD: Reporting results
